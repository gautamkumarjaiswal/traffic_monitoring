# traffic_monitoring
Detect car, bus, persons at traffic in real-time

Clone respository and extract 'traffic_monitoring' folder.
This repository containes sample images used to train faster R-CNN model, However, if you want to train your own model from sketch then follow https://github.com/gautamkumarjaiswal/TensorFlow-Object-Detection-API-Tutorial-Train-Multiple-Objects-Windows-10

You can use this pre-trained model to run on any image to detect car or bus.
How to run:
Clone repository, change directory, setup all environment as shown in tutorial link given above run command
python Detect_object_image.py # to detect objects in image and
python Detect_object_video.py # to detect objects in video
